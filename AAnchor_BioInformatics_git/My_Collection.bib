abstract = {This paper presents a novel methodology to analyze low resolution (e.g., 6 ˚ A to 10{\AA}10{\AA}) protein density map, that can be obtained through electron cryomicroscopy. At such resolutions, it is often not possible to recognize the backbone chain of the protein, but it is possible to identify individual structural elements (e.g., {\$}\alpha{\$}-helices and {\$}\beta{\$}-sheets). The methodology proposed in this paper performs gradients analysis to recognize volumes in the density map and to classify them. In particular, the focus is on the reliable identification of {\$}\alpha{\$}-helices. The methodology has been implemented in a tool, called Helix Tracer, and successfully tested with simulated structures, modeled from the Protein Data Bank at 10{\AA}10{\AA}resolution. The results of the study have been compared with the only other known tool with similar capabilities (Helixhunter), denoting significant improvements in recognition and precision.},

abstract = {Cryo-EM is a rapidly developing method to investigate the three dimensional structure of large macromolecular complexes. In spite of all the advances in the field, the resolution of most cryo-EM density maps is too low for de novo model building. Therefore, the data are often complemented by fitting high-resolution subunits in the density to allow for an atomic interpretation. Typically, the first step in the modeling process is placing the subunits in the density as a rigid body. An objective method for automatic placement is full-exhaustive six dimensional cross correlation search between the model and the cryo-EM data, where the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom are systematically sampled. In this article we present PowerFit, a Python package and program for fast and sensitive rigid body fitting. We introduce a novel, more sensitive scoring function, the core-weighted local cross correlation, and show how it can be calculated using FFTs for fast translational cross correlation scans. We further improved the search algorithm by using optimized rotational sets to reduce rotational redundancy and by limiting the cryo-EM data size through resampling and trimming the density. We demonstrate the superior scoring sensitivity of our scoring function on simulated data of the 80S D. melanogaster ribosome and on experimental data for four different cases. Through these advances, a fine-grained rotational search can now be performed within minutes on a CPU and seconds on a GPU. PowerFit is free software and can be downloaded from https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit.},

abstract = {We present computational solutions to two problems of macromolecular structure interpretation from reconstructed three-dimensional electron microscopy (3D-EM) maps of large bio-molecular complexes at intermediate resolution (5A-15 A). The two problems addressed are: 1) 3D structural alignment (matching) between identified and segmented 3D maps of structure units (e.g. trimeric configuration of proteins), and 2) the secondary structure identification of a segmented protein 3D map (i.e.locations of alpha-helices, beta-sheets). For problem 1, we present an efficient algorithm to correlate spatially (and structurally) two 3D maps of structure units. Besides providing a similarity score between structure units, the algorithm yields an effective technique for resolution refinement of repeated structure units, by 3D alignment and averaging. For problem 2, we present an efficient algorithm to compute eigenvalues and link eigenvectors of a Gaussian convoluted structure tensor derived from the protein 3D Map, thereby identifying and locating secondary structural motifs of proteins. The efficiency and performance of our approach is demonstrated on several experimentally reconstructed 3D maps of virus capsid shells from single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), as well as computationally simulated protein structure density 3D maps generated from protein model entries in the Protein Data Bank.},

It is still challenging to detect the SSE automatically and accurately from the density maps at medium resolutions (∼5-10 {\AA}). We present a machine learning approach, SSELearner, to automatically identify helices and $\beta$-sheets by using the knowledge from existing volumetric maps in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. We tested our approach using 10 simulated density maps. The averaged specificity and sensitivity for the helix detection are 94.9{\%} and 95.8{\%}, respectively, and those for the $\beta$-sheet detection are 86.7{\%} and 96.4{\%}, respectively. We have developed a secondary structure annotator, SSID, to predict the helices and $\beta$-strands from the backbone C$\alpha$ trace. With the help of SSID, we tested our SSELearner using 13 experimentally derived cryo-EM density maps. The machine learning approach shows the specificity and sensitivity of 91.8{\%} and 74.5{\%}, respectively, for the helix detection and 85.2{\%} and 86.5{\%} respectively for the $\beta$-sheet detection in cryoEM maps of Electron Microscopy Data Bank. The reduced detection accuracy reveals the challenges in SSE detection when the cryoEM maps are used instead of the simulated maps. Our results suggest that it is effective to use one cryoEM map for learning to detect the SSE in another cryoEM map of similar quality.},

We propose a method, StrandTwister, to detect the traces of $\beta$ strands through the analysis of twist, an intrinsic nature of a $\beta$ sheet. StrandTwister has been tested using 100 $\beta$ sheets simulated at 10 {\AA} resolution and 39 $\beta$ sheets computationally detected from cryo-EM density maps at 4.4-7.4 {\AA} resolutions. Although experimentally derived cryo-EM maps contain errors, StrandTwister's best detections over 39 cases were able to detect 81.87{\%} of the $\beta$ strands, with an overall 1.66 {\AA} two-way distance between the detected and observed $\beta$ traces. StrandTwister appears to detect the traces of $\beta$ strands on major $\beta$ sheets quite accurately, particularly at the central area of a $\beta$ sheet.},

abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the imaging of macromolecular complexes in near-native environments at resolutions that often permit the visualization of secondary structure elements. For example, alpha helices frequently show consistent patterns in volumetric maps, exhibiting rod-like structures of high density. Here, we introduce VolTrac (Volume Tracer) - a novel technique for the annotation of alpha-helical density in cryo-EM data sets. VolTrac combines a genetic algorithm and a bidirectional expansion with a tabu search strategy to trace helical regions. Our method takes advantage of the stochastic search by using a genetic algorithm to identify optimal placements for a short cylindrical template, avoiding exploration of already characterized tabu regions. These placements are then utilized as starting positions for the adaptive bidirectional expansion that characterizes the curvature and length of the helical region. The method reliably predicted helices with seven or more residues in experimental and simulated maps at intermediate (4-10. {\AA}) resolution. The observed success rates, ranging from 70.6{\%} to 100{\%}, depended on the map resolution and validation parameters. For successful predictions, the helical axes were located within 2. {\AA} from known helical axes of atomic structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Due to large sizes and complex nature, few large macromolecular complexes have been solved to atomic resolution. This has lead to an under-representation of these structures, which are composed of novel and/or homologous folds, in the library of known structures and folds. While it is often difficult to achieve a high-resolution model for these structures, X-ray crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy are capable of determining structures of large assemblies at low to intermediate resolutions. To aid in the interpretation and analysis of such structures, we have developed two programs: helixhunter and foldhunter. Helixhunter is capable of reliably identifying helix position, orientation and length using a five-dimensional cross-correlation search of a three-dimensional density map followed by feature extraction. Helixhunter's results can in turn be used to probe a library of secondary structure elements derived from the structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). From this analysis, it is then possible to identify potential homologous folds or suggest novel folds based on the arrangement of alpha helix elements, resulting in a structure-based recognition of folds containing alpha helices. Foldhunter uses a six-dimensional cross-correlation search allowing a probe structure to be fitted within a region or component of a target structure. The structural fitting therefore provides a quantitative means to further examine the architecture and organization of large, complex assemblies. These two methods have been successfully tested with simulated structures modeled from the PDB at resolutions between 6 and 12 {\AA}. With the integration of helixhunter and foldhunter into sequence and structural informatics techniques, we have the potential to deduce or confirm known or novel folds in domains or components within large complexes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

However, due to explaining away and unobserved common inputs (Stevenson et al., 2008), they produce spurious connections. The general linear model (GLM), which models spikes trains as Poisson processes (Okatan et al., 2005; Truccolo et al., 2005; Pillow et al., 2008), avoids these confounds. We develop here a new class of methods by using differential signals based on simulated intracellular voltage recordings. It is equivalent to a regularized AR(2) model. We also expand the method to simulated local field potential (LFP) recordings and calcium imaging. In all of our simulated data, the differential covariance-based methods achieved better or similar performance to the GLM method and required fewer data samples.

S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) acts as a signal and binds the methylase-2 domain of TP to induce conformational change of the viral capsid, which in turn activates the putative ATPase. ATP binding/hydrolysis leads to an enlarged capsid for efficient mRNA synthesis, an open GTase domain for His217-mediated guanylyl transfer, and an open methylase-1 domain for SAM binding and methyl transfer. Taken together, our data support a role of the putative ATPase in mediating the activation of mRNA transcription and capping within the confines of the virus.},

The ultimate outcome of a cryoEM study is an atomic model of a macromolecule or its complex with interacting partners. This chapter describes a variety of algorithms and software to build a de novo model based on the cryoEM 3D density map, to optimize the model with the best stereochemistry restraints and finally to validate the model with proper protocols. The full process of atomic structure determination from a cryoEM map is described. The tools outlined in this chapter should prove extremely valuable in revealing atomic interactions guided by cryoEM data.},

Bolstered by these advances, much effort has been directed toward the development of hybrid modeling methodologies for the construction and refinement of high-fidelity atomistic models from cryoEM data. In this brief review, we will survey the key elements of cryoEM-based hybrid modeling, providing an overview of available computational tools and strategies as well as several recent applications.},

@article{Dubochet2018,
abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) of non-crystalline single particles is a biophysical technique that can be used to determine the structure of biological macromolecules and assemblies. Historically, its potential for application in drug discovery has been heavily limited by two issues: the minimum size of the structures it can be used to study and the resolution of the images. However, recent technological advances — including the development of direct electron detectors and more effective computational image analysis techniques — are revolutionizing the utility of cryo-EM, leading to a burst of high-resolution structures of large macromolecular assemblies. These advances have raised hopes that single-particle cryo-EM might soon become an important tool for drug discovery, particularly if they could enable structural determination for 'intractable' targets that are still not accessible to X-ray crystallographic analysis. This article describes the recent advances in the field and critically assesses their relevance for drug discovery as well as discussing at what stages of the drug discovery pipeline cryo-EM can be useful today and what to expect in the near future.},

@article{Taigman,
abstract = {In modern face recognition, the conventional pipeline consists of four stages: detect ⇒ align ⇒ represent ⇒ clas-sify. We revisit both the alignment step and the representa-tion step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected layers without weight shar-ing, rather than the standard convolutional layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial dataset to-date, an iden-tity labeled dataset of four million facial images belong-ing to more than 4,000 identities. The learned representa-tions coupling the accurate model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably well to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier. Our method reaches an accuracy of 97.35{\%} on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, reducing the error of the current state of the art by more than 27{\%}, closely approach-ing human-level performance.},

abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30{\%} relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3{\%}. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/{\~{}}rbg/rcnn.},

abstract = {We trained a large, deep convolutional neural network to classify the 1.2 million high-resolution images in the ImageNet LSVRC-2010 contest into the 1000 dif-ferent classes. On the test data, we achieved top-1 and top-5 error rates of 37.5{\%} and 17.0{\%} which is considerably better than the previous state-of-the-art. The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called " dropout " that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},
