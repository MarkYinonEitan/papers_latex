abstract = {In the Ninth Edition of the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction (CASP9), 61,665 models submitted by 176 groups were assessed for their accuracy in the template based modeling category. The models were evaluated numerically in comparison to their experimental control structures using two global measures (GDT and GDC), and a novel local score evaluating the correct modeling of local interactions (lDDT). Overall, the state of the art of template based modeling in CASP9 is high, with many groups performing well. Among the methods registered as prediction "servers", six independent groups are performing on average better than the rest. The submissions by "human" groups are dominated by meta-predictors, with one group performing noticeably better than the others. Most of the participating groups failed to assign realistic confidence estimates to their predictions, and only a very small fraction of the assessed methods have provided highly accurate models and realistic error estimates at the same time. Also, the accuracy of predictions for homo-oligomeric assemblies was overall poor, and only one group performed better than a na{\"{i}}ve control predictor. Here, we present the results of our assessment of the CASP9 predictions in the category of template based modeling, documenting the state of the art and highlighting areas for future developments.},

abstract = {Detection and classification of cell nuclei in histopathology images of cancerous tissue stained with the standard hematoxylin and eosin stain is a challenging task due to cellular heterogeneity. Deep learning approaches have been shown to produce encouraging results on histopathology images in various studies. In this paper, we propose a Spatially Constrained Convolutional Neural Network (SC-CNN) to perform nucleus detection. SC-CNN regresses the likelihood of a pixel being the center of a nucleus, where high probability values are spatially constrained to locate in the vicinity of the center of nuclei. For classification of nuclei, we propose a novel Neighboring Ensemble Predictor (NEP) coupled with CNN to more accurately predict the class label of detected cell nuclei. The proposed approaches for detection and classification do not require segmentation of nuclei. We have evaluated them on a large dataset of colorectal adenocarcinoma images, consisting of more than 20,000 annotated nuclei belonging to four different classes. Our results show that the joint detection and classification of the proposed SC-CNN and NEP produces the highest average F1 score as compared to other recently published approaches. Prospectively, the proposed methods could offer benefit to pathology practice in terms of quantitative analysis of tissue constituents in whole-slide images, and could potentially lead to a better understanding of cancer.},

However, tracing the main-chains and building full-atom models from EM maps of {\~{}}4–5 {\AA} is still not trivial and remains a time-consuming task. Here, we introduce a fully automated de novo structure modeling method, MAINMAST, which builds three-dimensional models of a protein from a near-atomic resolution EM map. The method directly traces the protein's main-chain and identifies C$\alpha$ positions as tree-graph structures in the EM map. MAINMAST performs significantly better than existing software in building global protein structure models on data sets of 40 simulated density maps at 5 {\AA} resolution and 30 experimentally determined maps at 2.6–4.8 {\AA} resolution.

In the secondary structure stage, helices and strands are identified with pre-computed templates, and the voxel size of the entire map is then refined to account for microscopic magnification errors. The identified secondary structures are then extended from both ends in the C$\alpha$ stage via a log-likelihood (LLK) target function, and if possible, the side chains are also assigned.

This review outlines recent methodical advances in homology modelling, with a focus on those techniques that necessitate consideration of ligand binding. In this context, model quality estimation deserves special attention because the accuracy and reliability of different structure prediction techniques vary considerably, and the quality of a model ultimately determines its usefulness for structure-based drug discovery.

These proximity patches, which exhibit higher values for pixels near cell centers, will then be gathered from all testing image patches and fused to obtain the final proximity map, where the maximum positions indicate the cell centroids. The algorithm is tested using three data sets representing different image stains and modalities.

Nevertheless, owing to their large size and instability, deciphering the atomic structure of macromolecular assemblies is still considered as a challenging task that cannot keep up with the rapid advances in the protein-identification process. In contrast, structural data at lower resolution is becoming more and more available owing to recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques. Once a cryo-EM map is acquired, one of the basic questions asked is what are the folds of the components in the assembly and what is their configuration. Here, a novel knowledge-based computational method, named EMatch, towards tackling this task for cryo-EM maps at 6-10 A resolution is presented. The method recognizes and locates possible atomic resolution structural homologues of protein domains in the assembly. The strengths of EMatch are demonstrated on a cryo-EM map of native GroEL at 6 A resolution.},

abstract = {Structural analysis of biological machines is essential for inferring their function and mechanism. Nevertheless, owing to their large size and instability, deciphering the atomic structure of macromolecular assemblies is still considered as a challenging task that cannot keep up with the rapid advances in the protein-identification process. In contrast, structural data at lower resolution is becoming more and more available owing to recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques. Once a cryo-EM map is acquired, one of the basic questions asked is what are the folds of the components in the assembly and what is their configuration. Here, a novel knowledge-based computational method, named EMatch, towards tackling this task for cryo-EM maps at 6-10 A resolution is presented. The method recognizes and locates possible atomic resolution structural homologues of protein domains in the assembly. The strengths of EMatch are demonstrated on a cryo-EM map of native GroEL at 6 A resolution.},

abstract = {Due to large sizes and complex nature, few large macromolecular complexes have been solved to atomic resolution. This has lead to an under-representation of these structures, which are composed of novel and/or homologous folds, in the library of known structures and folds. While it is often difficult to achieve a high-resolution model for these structures, X-ray crystallography and electron cryomicroscopy are capable of determining structures of large assemblies at low to intermediate resolutions. To aid in the interpretation and analysis of such structures, we have developed two programs: helixhunter and foldhunter. Helixhunter is capable of reliably identifying helix position, orientation and length using a five-dimensional cross-correlation search of a three-dimensional density map followed by feature extraction. Helixhunter's results can in turn be used to probe a library of secondary structure elements derived from the structures in the Protein Data Bank (PDB). From this analysis, it is then possible to identify potential homologous folds or suggest novel folds based on the arrangement of alpha helix elements, resulting in a structure-based recognition of folds containing alpha helices. Foldhunter uses a six-dimensional cross-correlation search allowing a probe structure to be fitted within a region or component of a target structure. The structural fitting therefore provides a quantitative means to further examine the architecture and organization of large, complex assemblies. These two methods have been successfully tested with simulated structures modeled from the PDB at resolutions between 6 and 12 {\AA}. With the integration of helixhunter and foldhunter into sequence and structural informatics techniques, we have the potential to deduce or confirm known or novel folds in domains or components within large complexes. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

We revisit both the alignment step and the representa-tion step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected layers without weight shar-ing, rather than the standard convolutional layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial dataset to-date, an iden-tity labeled dataset of four million facial images belong-ing to more than 4,000 identities. The learned representa-tions coupling the accurate model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably well to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier. Our method reaches an accuracy of 97.35{\%} on the Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset, reducing the error of the current state of the art by more than 27{\%}, closely approach-ing human-level performance.},

We suggest how to exploit comparative models for molecular screens, based on docking against a wide range of crystallographic structures and comparative models with known ligands. To account for the variation in the ligand-binding pocket as it binds different ligands, we calculate "consensus" enrichment by ranking each library compound by its best docking score against all available comparative models and/or modeling templates. For the majority of the targets, the consensus enrichment for multiple models was better than or comparable to that of the holo and apo X-ray structures. Even for single models, the models are significantly more enriching than the template structure if the template is paralogous and shares more than 25{\%} sequence identity with the target.},

Despite efforts, a high-resolution structure of a channel for this family of proteins has been elusive and therefore the mechanism of activation and membrane insertion remains unclear. Here we determine the pore structure of lysenin by single particle cryo-EM, to 3.1 {\AA} resolution. The nonameric assembly reveals a long $\beta$-barrel channel spanning the length of the complex that, unexpectedly, includes the two pre-insertion strands flanking the hypothetical membrane-insertion loop. Examination of other members of the aerolysin family reveals high structural preservation in this region, indicating that the membrane-insertion pathway in this family is conserved. For some toxins, proteolytic activation and pro-peptide removal will facilitate unfolding of the pre-insertion strands, allowing them to form the $\beta$-barrel of the channel.},

Protective antigen forms oligomeric prepores that undergo conversion to membrane-spanning pores by endosomal acidification, and these pores translocate the enzymes lethal factor and oedema factor into the cytosol of target cells. Protective antigen is not only a vaccine component and therapeutic target for anthrax infections but also an excellent model system for understanding the mechanism of protein translocation. On the basis of biochemical and electrophysiological results, researchers have proposed that a phi ($\Phi$)-clamp composed of phenylalanine (Phe)427 residues of protective antigen catalyses protein translocation via a charge-state-dependent Brownian ratchet. Although atomic structures of protective antigen prepores are available, how protective antigen senses low pH, converts to active pore, and translocates lethal factor and oedema factor are not well defined without an atomic model of its pore. Here, by cryo-electron microscopy with direct electron counting, we determine the protective antigen pore structure at 2.9-{\AA} resolution. The structure reveals the long-sought-after catalytic $\Phi$-clamp and the membrane-spanning translocation channel, and supports the Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation. Comparisons of four structures reveal conformational changes in prepore to pore conversion that support a multi-step mechanism by which low pH is sensed and the membrane-spanning channel is formed.},

The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30{\%} relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3{\%}. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset.

abstract = {Central to protein biology is the understanding of how structural elements give rise to observed function. The surfeit of protein structural data enables development of computational methods to systematically derive rules governing structural-functional relationships. However, performance of these methods depends critically on the choice of protein structural representation. Most current methods rely on features that are manually selected based on knowledge about protein structures. These are often general-purpose but not optimized for the specific application of interest. In this paper, we present a general framework that applies 3D convolutional neural network (3DCNN) technology to structure-based protein analysis. The framework automatically extracts task-specific features from the raw atom distribution, driven by supervised labels. As a pilot study, we use our network to analyze local protein microenvironments surrounding the 20 amino acids, and predict the amino acids most compatible with environments within a protein structure. To further validate the power of our method, we construct two amino acid substitution matrices from the prediction statistics and use them to predict effects of mutations in T4 lysozyme structures. Our deep 3DCNN achieves a two-fold increase in prediction accuracy compared to models that employ conventional hand-engineered features and successfully recapitulates known information about similar and different microenvironments. Models built from our predictions and substitution matrices achieve an 85{\%} accuracy predicting outcomes of the T4 lysozyme mutation variants. Our substitution matrices contain rich information relevant to mutation analysis compared to well-established substitution matrices. Finally, we present a visualization method to inspect the individual contributions of each atom to the classification decisions. End-to-end trained deep learning networks consistently outperform methods using hand-engineered features, suggesting that the 3DCNN framework is well suited for analysis of protein microenvironments and may be useful for other protein structural analyses.},

The neural network, which has 60 million parameters and 650,000 neurons, consists of five convolutional layers, some of which are followed by max-pooling layers, and three fully-connected layers with a final 1000-way softmax. To make train-ing faster, we used non-saturating neurons and a very efficient GPU implemen-tation of the convolution operation. To reduce overfitting in the fully-connected layers we employed a recently-developed regularization method called " dropout " that proved to be very effective. We also entered a variant of this model in the ILSVRC-2012 competition and achieved a winning top-5 test error rate of 15.3{\%}, compared to 26.2{\%} achieved by the second-best entry.},

abstract = {The accuracy of the secondary structure element (SSE) identification from volumetric protein density maps is critical for de-novo backbone structure derivation in electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM). It is still challenging to detect the SSE automatically and accurately from the density maps at medium resolutions (∼5-10 {\AA}). We present a machine learning approach, SSELearner, to automatically identify helices and $\beta$-sheets by using the knowledge from existing volumetric maps in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. We tested our approach using 10 simulated density maps. The averaged specificity and sensitivity for the helix detection are 94.9{\%} and 95.8{\%}, respectively, and those for the $\beta$-sheet detection are 86.7{\%} and 96.4{\%}, respectively. We have developed a secondary structure annotator, SSID, to predict the helices and $\beta$-strands from the backbone C$\alpha$ trace. With the help of SSID, we tested our SSELearner using 13 experimentally derived cryo-EM density maps. The machine learning approach shows the specificity and sensitivity of 91.8{\%} and 74.5{\%}, respectively, for the helix detection and 85.2{\%} and 86.5{\%} respectively for the $\beta$-sheet detection in cryoEM maps of Electron Microscopy Data Bank. The reduced detection accuracy reveals the challenges in SSE detection when the cryoEM maps are used instead of the simulated maps. Our results suggest that it is effective to use one cryoEM map for learning to detect the SSE in another cryoEM map of similar quality.},

abstract = {Cryo-EM is a rapidly developing method to investigate the three dimensional structure of large macromolecular complexes. In spite of all the advances in the field, the resolution of most cryo-EM density maps is too low for de novo model building. Therefore, the data are often complemented by fitting high-resolution subunits in the density to allow for an atomic interpretation. Typically, the first step in the modeling process is placing the subunits in the density as a rigid body. An objective method for automatic placement is full-exhaustive six dimensional cross correlation search between the model and the cryo-EM data, where the three translational and three rotational degrees of freedom are systematically sampled. In this article we present PowerFit, a Python package and program for fast and sensitive rigid body fitting. We introduce a novel, more sensitive scoring function, the core-weighted local cross correlation, and show how it can be calculated using FFTs for fast translational cross correlation scans. We further improved the search algorithm by using optimized rotational sets to reduce rotational redundancy and by limiting the cryo-EM data size through resampling and trimming the density. We demonstrate the superior scoring sensitivity of our scoring function on simulated data of the 80S D. melanogaster ribosome and on experimental data for four different cases. Through these advances, a fine-grained rotational search can now be performed within minutes on a CPU and seconds on a GPU. PowerFit is free software and can be downloaded from https://github.com/haddocking/powerfit.},

abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) enables the imaging of macromolecular complexes in near-native environments at resolutions that often permit the visualization of secondary structure elements. For example, alpha helices frequently show consistent patterns in volumetric maps, exhibiting rod-like structures of high density. Here, we introduce VolTrac (Volume Tracer) - a novel technique for the annotation of alpha-helical density in cryo-EM data sets. VolTrac combines a genetic algorithm and a bidirectional expansion with a tabu search strategy to trace helical regions. Our method takes advantage of the stochastic search by using a genetic algorithm to identify optimal placements for a short cylindrical template, avoiding exploration of already characterized tabu regions. These placements are then utilized as starting positions for the adaptive bidirectional expansion that characterizes the curvature and length of the helical region. The method reliably predicted helices with seven or more residues in experimental and simulated maps at intermediate (4-10. {\AA}) resolution. The observed success rates, ranging from 70.6{\%} to 100{\%}, depended on the map resolution and validation parameters. For successful predictions, the helical axes were located within 2. {\AA} from known helical axes of atomic structures. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

However, there are few software tools for modeling protein structure from cryo-EM density maps in this resolution range. Here, we present an extension of our original Pathwalking protocol, which can automatically trace a protein backbone directly from a near-atomic resolution (3–6 {\AA}) density map. The original Pathwalking approach utilized a Traveling Salesman Problem solver for backbone tracing, but manual adjustment was still required during modeling. In the new version, human intervention is minimized and we provide a more robust approach for backbone modeling. This includes iterative secondary structure identification, termini detection and the ability to model multiple subunits without prior segmentation. Overall, the new Pathwalking procedure provides a more complete and robust tool for annotating protein structure function in near-atomic resolution density maps.},

Functional connectivity is one popular way to study the relationship between multiple neural signals. Correlation-based methods are a set of currently well-used techniques for functional connectivity estimation. However, due to explaining away and unobserved common inputs (Stevenson et al., 2008), they produce spurious connections. The general linear model (GLM), which models spikes trains as Poisson processes (Okatan et al., 2005; Truccolo et al., 2005; Pillow et al., 2008), avoids these confounds. We develop here a new class of methods by using differential signals based on simulated intracellular voltage recordings. It is equivalent to a regularized AR(2) model. We also expand the method to simulated local field potential (LFP) recordings and calcium imaging. In all of our simulated data, the differential covariance-based methods achieved better or similar performance to the GLM method and required fewer data samples. This new class of methods provides alternative ways to analyze neural signals.},

Here, by nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) assay and comparisons of six high-resolution (2.9–3. A) cryo-electron microscopy structures of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus with bound ligands, we show that the large sub-domain of the guanylyltransferase (GTase) domain of the turret protein (TP) also has an ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) acts as a signal and binds the methylase-2 domain of TP to induce conformational change of the viral capsid, which in turn activates the putative ATPase. ATP binding/hydrolysis leads to an enlarged capsid for efficient mRNA synthesis, an open GTase domain for His217-mediated guanylyl transfer, and an open methylase-1 domain for SAM binding and methyl transfer. Taken together, our data support a role of the putative ATPase in mediating the activation of mRNA transcription and capping within the confines of the virus.},

abstract = {Image representation plays an important role in medical image analysis. The key to the success of different medical image analysis algorithms is heavily dependent on how we represent the input data, namely features used to characterize the input image. In the literature, feature engineering remains as an active research topic, and many novel hand-crafted features are designed such as Haar wavelet, histogram of oriented gradient, and local binary patterns. However, such features are not designed with the guidance of the underlying dataset at hand. To this end, we argue that the most effective features should be designed in a learning based manner, namely representation learning, which can be adapted to different patient datasets at hand. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning framework to achieve this goal. Specifically, a stacked independent subspace analysis (ISA) network is adopted to learn the most effective features in a hierarchical and unsupervised manner. The learnt features are adapted to the dataset at hand and encode high level semantic anatomical information. The proposed method is evaluated on the application of automatic prostate MR segmentation. Experimental results show that significant segmentation accuracy improvement can be achieved by the proposed deep learning method compared to other state-of-the-art segmentation approaches.},

For problem 1, we present an efficient algorithm to correlate spatially (and structurally) two 3D maps of structure units. Besides providing a similarity score between structure units, the algorithm yields an effective technique for resolution refinement of repeated structure units, by 3D alignment and averaging. For problem 2, we present an efficient algorithm to compute eigenvalues and link eigenvectors of a Gaussian convoluted structure tensor derived from the protein 3D Map, thereby identifying and locating secondary structural motifs of proteins.

abstract = {We present an updated and integrated version of our widely used protein-protein docking and binding affinity benchmarks. The benchmarks consist of non-redundant, high-quality structures of protein-protein complexes along with the unbound structures of their components. Fifty-five new complexes were added to the docking benchmark, 35 of which have experimentally measured binding affinities. These updated docking and affinity benchmarks now contain 230 and 179 entries, respectively. In particular, the number of antibody-antigen complexes has increased significantly, by 67{\%} and 74{\%} in the docking and affinity benchmarks, respectively. We tested previously developed docking and affinity prediction algorithms on the new cases. Considering only the top 10 docking predictions per benchmark case, a prediction accuracy of 38{\%} is achieved on all 55 cases and up to 50{\%} for the 32 rigid-body cases only. Predicted affinity scores are found to correlate with experimental binding energies up to r = 0.52 overall and r = 0.72 for the rigid complexes.},

abstract = {Learning to predict future images from a video sequence involves the construction of an internal representation that models the image evolution accurately, and therefore, to some degree, its content and dynamics. This is why pixel-space video prediction may be viewed as a promising avenue for unsupervised feature learning. In addition, while optical flow has been a very studied problem in computer vision for a long time, future frame prediction is rarely approached. Still, many vision applications could benefit from the knowledge of the next frames of videos, that does not require the complexity of tracking every pixel trajectories. In this work, we train a convolutional network to generate future frames given an input sequence. To deal with the inherently blurry predictions obtained from the standard Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function, we propose three different and complementary feature learning strategies: a multi-scale architecture, an adversarial training method, and an image gradient difference loss function. We compare our predictions to different published results based on recurrent neural networks on the UCF101 dataset},

Fine-tuning deep models in a new domain can require a significant amount of data, which for many applications is simply not available. We propose a new CNN architecture which introduces an adaptation layer and an additional domain confusion loss, to learn a representation that is both semantically meaningful and domain invariant. We additionally show that a domain confusion metric can be used for model selection to determine the dimension of an adaptation layer and the best position for the layer in the CNN architecture. Our proposed adaptation method offers empirical performance which exceeds previously published results on a standard benchmark visual domain adaptation task.},

abstract = {In this book, we've focused on the nuts and bolts of neural networks: how they work, and how they can be used to solve pattern recognition problems. This is material with many immediate practical applications. But, of course, one reason for interest in neural nets is the hope that one day they will go far beyond such basic pattern recognition problems. Perhaps they, or some other approach based on digital computers, will eventually be used to build thinking machines, machines that match or surpass human intelligence? This notion far exceeds the material discussed in the book -or what anyone in the world knows how to do. But it's fun to speculate. There has been much debate about whether it's even possible for computers to match human intelligence. I'm not going to engage with that question. Despite ongoing dispute, I believe it's not in serious doubt that an intelligent computer is possible -although it may be extremely complicated, and perhaps far beyond current technology -and current naysayers will one day seem much like the vitalists. Rather, the question I explore here is whether there is a simple set of principles which can be used to explain intelligence? In particular, and more concretely, is there a simple algorithm for intelligence? The idea that there is a truly simple algorithm for intelligence is a bold idea. It perhaps sounds too optimistic to be true. Many people have a strong intuitive sense that intelligence has considerable irreducible complexity. They're so impressed by the amazing variety and flexibility of human thought that they conclude that a simple algorithm for intelligence must be impossible. Despite this intuition, I don't think it's wise to rush to judgement. The history of science is filled with instances where a phenomenon initially appeared extremely complex, but was later explained by some simple but powerful set of ideas. Consider, for example, the early days of astronomy. Humans have known since ancient times that there is a menagerie of objects in the sky: the sun, the moon, the planets, the comets, and the stars.},

The SVM method achieved a good performance of segment overlap accuracy SOV  76.2 {\%} through sevenfold cross validation on a database of 513 non-homologous protein chains with multiple sequence alignments, which out-performs existing methods. Meanwhile three-state overall per-residue accuracy Q 3 achieved 73.5 {\%}, which is at least com-parable to existing single prediction methods. Furthermore a usefureliability index'' for the predictions was developed. In addition, SVM has many attractive features, including effective avoidance of over{\textregistered}tting, the ability to handle large feature spaces, information condensing of the given data set, etc. The SVM method is conveniently applied to many other pattern classi{\textregistered}cation tasks in biology.},

abstract = {Background: Most profile and motif databases strive to classify protein sequences into a broad spectrum of protein families. The next step of such database studies should include the development of classification systems capable of distinguishing between subfamilies within a structurally and functionally diverse superfamily. This would be helpful in elucidating sequence-structure-function relationships of proteins. Results: Here, we present a method to diagnose sequences into subfamilies by employing hidden Markov models (HMMs) to find windows of residues that are distinct among subfamilies (called signatures). The method starts with a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the subfamily. Then, we build a HMM database representing all sliding windows of the MSA of a fixed size. Finally, we construct a HMM histogram of the matches of each sliding window in the entire superfamily. To illustrate the efficacy of the method, we have applied the analysis to find subfamily signatures in two well-studied superfamilies: the cadherin and the EF-hand protein superfamilies. As a corollary, the HMM histograms of the analyzed subfamilies revealed information about their Ca2+ binding sites and loops. Conclusions: The method is used to create HMM databases to diagnose subfamilies of protein superfamilies that complement broad profile and motif databases such as BLOCKS, PROSITE, Pfam, SMART, PRINTS and InterPro. {\textcopyright} 2002 Truong and Ikura; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

At such resolutions, it is often not possible to recognize the backbone chain of the protein, but it is possible to identify individual structural elements (e.g., $\alpha$-helices and $\beta$-sheets). The methodology proposed in this paper performs gradients analysis to recognize volumes in the density map and to classify them. In particular, the focus is on the reliable identification of $\alpha$-helices. The methodology has been implemented in a tool, called Helix Tracer, and successfully tested with simulated structures, modeled from the Protein Data Bank at 10{\AA}10{\AA} resolution. The results of the study have been compared with the only other known tool with similar capabilities (Helixhunter), denoting significant improvements in recognition and precision.},

abstract = {Adversarial discriminative domain adaptation (ADDA) is an efficient framework for unsupervised domain adaptation, where the source and target domains are assumed to have the same classes, but no labels are available for the target domain. While ADDA has already achieved better training efficiency and competitive accuracy in comparison to other adversarial based methods, we investigate whether we can improve performance by incorporating task knowledge into the adversarial loss functions. We achieve this by extending the discriminator output over the source classes and leverage on the distribution over the source encoder posteriors, which is fixed during adversarial training, in order to align a shared encoder distribution to the source domain. The shared encoder can receive a proportion of examples from both the source and target datasets, in order to smooth the learned distribution and improve its convergence properties during adversarial training. We additionally consider how the extended discriminator can be regularized in order to further improve performance, by treating the discriminator as a denoising autoencoder and corrupting its input. Our final design employs maximum mean discrepancy and reconstruction-based loss functions for adversarial training. We validate our framework on standard datasets like MNIST, USPS, SVHN, MNIST-M and Office-31. Our results on all datasets show that our proposal is both simple and efficient, as it competes or outperforms the state-of-the-art in unsupervised domain adaptation, whilst offering lower complexity than other recent adversarial methods such as DIFA and CoGAN.},

abstract = {Cells are interactive living systems where protein-protein bindings constitute fundamental keystones in cell construction, regulation and signalling. How physico-chemical and geometrical properties of the protein interfaces associate their effects to determine a functional interaction remains far from fully understood. Different models estimating the strength of the interaction between proteins forming a complex have been previously proposed and recently compared against experimental measures. Here, we explore the geometry of contact distribution at protein-protein interfaces and provide an improved model of the binding energy between pairs of proteins forming complexes. Local Interaction Signal Analysis (LISA) is a radial function based on terms describing favorable and non-favorable contacts obtained by Density Functional Theory, the Support-Core-Rim interface residue distribution, non-interacting charged residues and secondary structures contribution. The three-dimensional organisation of the contacts and their contribu-tion on localised hot-sites over the entire interaction surface were numerically evaluated. LISA achieves a correlation of 0.81 (and RMSE of 2.35 ± 0.38 kcal/mol) when tested on 125 complexes for which experi-mental measurements were realised with selected technologies (stopped-flow, surface plasmon resonance, spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry). LISA's performance is stable for subsets defined by functional composition and extent of conformational changes upon complex formation. A large-scale comparison with 17 other functions was assessed and demonstrated the power of the geometrical model in the understanding of complex binding.},

abstract = {The cortical motor areas are activated not only during contralateral limb movements but also during ipsilateral limb movements. Although these ipsilateral activities have been observed in several brain imaging studies, their functional role is poorly understood. Due to its high temporal resolution and low susceptibility to artifacts from body movements, the electrocorticogram (ECoG) is an advantageous measurement method for assessing the human brain function of motor behaviors. Here, we demonstrate that contra- and ipsilateral movements share a similarity in the high-frequency band of human ECoG signals. The ECoG signals were measured from the unilateral sensorimotor cortex while patients conducted self-paced movements of different body parts, contra- or ipsilateral to the measurement side. The movement categories (wrist, shoulder, or ankle) of ipsilateral movements were decoded as accurately as those of contralateral movements from spatial patterns of the high-frequency band of the precentral motor area (the primary motor and premotor areas). The decoder, trained in the high-frequency band of ipsilateral movements generalized to contralateral movements, and vice versa, confirmed that the activity patterns related to ipsilateral limb movements were similar to contralateral ones in the precentral motor area. Our results suggest that the high-frequency band activity patterns of ipsilateral and contralateral movements might be functionally coupled to control limbs, even during unilateral movements.},

abstract = {Ligand-binding proteins play key roles in many biological processes. Identification of protein-ligand binding residues is important in understanding the biological functions of proteins. Existing computational methods can be roughly categorized as sequence-based or 3D-structure-based methods. All these methods are based on traditional machine learning. In a series of binding residue prediction tasks, 3D-structure-based methods are widely superior to sequence-based methods. However, due to the great number of proteins with known amino acid sequences, sequence-based methods have considerable room for improvement with the development of deep learning. Therefore, prediction of protein-ligand binding residues with deep learning requires study. In this study, we propose a new sequence-based approach called DeepCSeqSite for ab initio protein-ligand binding residue prediction. DeepCSeqSite includes a standard edition and an enhanced edition. The classifier of DeepCSeqSite is based on a deep convolutional neural network. Several convolutional layers are stacked on top of each other to extract hierarchical features. The size of the effective context scope is expanded as the number of convolutional layers increases. The long-distance dependencies between residues can be captured by the large effective context scope, and stacking several layers enables the maximum length of dependencies to be precisely controlled. The extracted features are ultimately combined through one-by-one convolution kernels and softmax to predict whether the residues are binding residues. The state-of-the-art ligand-binding method COACH and some of its submethods are selected as baselines. The methods are tested on a set of 151 nonredundant proteins and three extended test sets. Experiments show that the improvement of the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) is no less than 0.05. In addition, a training data augmentation method that slightly improves the performance is discussed in this study. Without using any templates that include 3D-structure data, DeepCSeqSite significantlyoutperforms existing sequence-based and 3D-structure-based methods, including COACH. Augmentation of the training sets slightly improves the performance. The model, code and datasets are available at

abstract = {Polar residue hot spots have been observed at protein-protein binding sites. Here we show that hot spots occur predominantly at the interfaces of macromolecular complexes, distinguishing binding sites from the remainder of the surface. Consequently, hot spots can be used to define binding epitopes. We further show a correspondence between energy hot spots and structurally conserved residues. The number of structurally conserved residues, particularly of high ranking energy hot spots, increases with the binding site contact size. This finding may suggest that effectively dispersing hot spots within a large contact area, rather than compactly clustering them, may be a strategy to sustain essential key interactions while still allowing certain protein flexibility at the interface. Thus, most conserved polar residues at the binding interfaces confer rigidity to minimize the entropic cost on binding, whereas surrounding residues form a flexible cushion. Furthermore, our finding that similar residue hot spots occur across different protein families suggests that affinity and specificity are not necessarily coupled: higher affinity does not directly imply greater specificity. Conservation of Trp on the protein surface indicates a highly likely binding site. To a lesser extent, conservation of Phe and Met also imply a binding site. For all three residues, there is a significant conservation in binding sites, whereas there is no conservation on the exposed surface. A hybrid strategy, mapping sequence alignment onto a single structure illustrates the possibility of binding site identification around these three residues.},

abstract = {The Protein Data Bank in Europe (PDBe; pdbe.org) is actively involved in managing the international archive of biomacromolecular structure data as one of the partners in the Worldwide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB; wwpdb.org). PDBe also develops new tools to make structural data more widely and more easily available to the biomedical community. PDBe has developed a browser to access and analyze the structural archive using classification systems that are familiar to chemists and biologists. The PDBe web pages that describe individual PDB entries have been enhanced through the introduction of plain-English summary pages and iconic representations of the contents of an entry (PDBprints). In addition, the information available for structures determined by means of NMR spectroscopy has been expanded. Finally, the entire web site has been redesigned to make it substantially easier to use for expert and novice users alike. PDBe works closely with other teams at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI) and in the international scientific community to develop new resources with value-added information. The SIFTS initiative is an example of such a collaboration--it provides extensive mapping data between proteins whose structures are available from the PDB and a host of other biomedical databases. SIFTS is widely used by major bioinformatics resources.},

abstract = {Location problems with extensive facilities represent a challenging field of research. According to the specialized literature, a facility is called extensive if, for purposes of location, it is too large in relation to its environment to be considered a point. There are many examples of this type of structures that appear in real-world applications both in the continuous space (straight lines, circles, strips) and in net-works (paths, cycles, trees). There exists a recent literature review on the location of dimensional facilities on continuous space (D{\'{i}}az-B{\'{a}}{\~{n}}ez et al. in TOP 154:22–44, 2004; Sch{\"{o}}bel in Location of dimensional facilities in a continuous space, 2015) that does not cover similar problems on networks. The goal of this paper is to review the location of dimensional facilities in networks. We mainly concentrate on the location of paths and trees considering the most common objective functions in the location literature, namely median and center. However, we also consider some other alterna-This invited paper is discussed in the comments available at https: J.

We include the basic tools and techniques that are applicable to develop algorithms for this kind of problems. Moreover, we present the best known complexity results for each of the considered problems. Finally, some suggestions are also made for possible directions of future research.},

abstract = {Multi-protein complexes are emerging as important entities of biological activity inside cells that serve to create functional diversity by contextual combination of gene products and, at the same time, organize the large number of different proteins into functional units. Many a time, when studying protein complexes rather than individual proteins, the biological insight gained has been fundamental, particularly in cases in which proteins with no previous functional annotation could be placed into a functional context derived from their 'molecular environment'. In this minireview, we summarize the current state of the art for the retrieval of multiprotein complexes by affinity purification and their analysis by mass spectrometry. The advances in technology made over the past few years now enable the study of protein complexes on a proteomic scale and it can be anticipated that the knowledge gathered from such projects will fuel drug target discovery and validation pipelines and that the technology is also going to prove valuable in the emerging field of systems biology.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider the location of a tree-shaped facility S on a tree network, using the ordered median function of the weighted distances to represent the total transportation cost objective. This function unifies and generalizes the most common criteria used in location modeling, e.g., median and center. If there are n demand points at the nodes of the tree T=(V,E), this function is characterized by a sequence of reals, $\Lambda$=($\lambda$ 1, . . . ,$\lambda$ n ), satisfying $\lambda$ 1Ge;$\lambda$ 2≥$\lambda$ n ≥0. For a given subtree S let X(S)={\{}x 1, . . . ,x n {\}} be the set of weighted distances of the n demand points from S. The value of the ordered median objective at S is obtained as follows: Sort the n elements in X(S) in nonincreasing order, and then compute the scalar product of the sorted list with the sequence $\Lambda$. Two models are discussed. In the tactical model, there is an explicit bound L on the length of the subtree, and the goal is to select a subtree of size L, which minimizes the above transportation cost function. In the strategic model the length of the subtree is variable, and the objective is to minimize the sum of the transportation cost and the length of the subtree. We consider both discrete and continuous versions of the tactical and the strategic models. We note that the discrete tactical problem is NP-hard, and we solve the continuous tactical problem in polynomial time using a Linear Programming (LP) approach. We also prove submodularity properties for the strategic problem. These properties allow us to solve the discrete strategic version in strongly polynomial time. Moreover the continuous version is also solved via LP. For the special case of the k-centrum objective we obtain improved algorithmic results using a Dynamic Programming (DP) algorithm and discretization and nestedness results. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2004.},

Here we show that sequence specificities can be ascertained from experimental data with 'deep learning' techniques, which offer a scalable, flexible and unified computational approach for pattern discovery. Using a diverse array of experimental data and evaluation metrics, we find that deep learning outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, even when training on in vitro data and testing on in vivo data. We call this approach DeepBind and have built a stand-alone software tool that is fully automatic and handles millions of sequences per experiment.

Because crystallization is not required, only small amounts of sample are needed, and because images can be classified in a computer, the technique has the potential to deal with compositional and conformational mixtures. Therefore, cryo-EM can be used to investigate complete and fully functional macromolecular complexes in different functional states, providing a richness of biological insight. In this review, we underlie some of the principles behind the cryo-EM methodology of single particle analysis and discuss some recent results of its application to challenging systems of paramount biological importance.

abstract = {The current status of docking procedures for predicting protein-protein interactions starting from their three-dimensional structure is assessed from a first major evaluation of blind predictions. This evaluation was performed as part of a communitywide experiment on Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions (CAPRI). Seven newly determined structures of protein-protein complexes were available as targets for this experiment. These were the complexes between a kinase and its protein substrate, between a T-cell receptor beta-chain and a superantigen, and five antigen-antibody complexes. For each target, the predictors were given the experimental structures of the free components, or of one free and one bound component in a random orientation. The structure of the complex was revealed only at the time of the evaluation. A total of 465 predictions submitted by 19 groups were evaluated. These groups used a wide range of algorithms and scoring functions, some of which were completely novel. The quality of the predicted interactions was evaluated by comparing residue-residue contacts and interface residues to those in the X-ray structures and by analyzing the fit of the ligand molecules (the smaller of the two proteins in the complex) or of interface residues only, in the predicted versus target complexes. A total of 14 groups produced predictions, ranking from acceptable to highly accurate for five of the seven targets. The use of available biochemical and biological information, and in one instance structural information, played a key role in achieving this result. It was essential for identifying the native binding modes for the five correctly predicted targets, including the kinase-substrate complex where the enzyme changes conformation on association. But it was also the cause for missing the correct solution for the two remaining unpredicted targets, which involve unexpected antigen-antibody binding modes. Overall, this analysis reveals genuine progress in docking procedures but also illustrates the remaining serious limitations and points out the need for better scoring functions and more effective ways for handling conformational flexibility.},

The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

abstract = {Ensembles of protein structures are increasingly used to represent the conformational variation of a protein as determined by experiment and/or by molecular simulations, as well as uncertainties that may be associated with structure determinations or predictions. Making the best use of such information requires the ability to quantitatively compare entire ensembles. For this reason, we recently introduced the Ensemblator (Clark et al., Protein Sci 2015; 24:1528), a novel approach to compare user-defined groups of models, in residue level detail. Here we describe Ensemblator v3, an open-source program that employs the same basic ensemble comparison strategy but includes major advances that make it more robust, powerful, and user-friendly. Ensemblator v3 carries out multiple sequence alignments to facilitate the generation of ensembles from non-identical input structures, automatically optimizes the key global overlay parameter, optionally performs “ensemble clustering” to classify the models into subgroups, and calculates a novel “discrimination index” that quantifies similarities and differences, at residue or atom level, between each pair of subgroups. The clustering and automatic options mean that no pre-knowledge about an ensemble is required for its analysis. After describing the novel features of Ensemblator v3, we demonstrate its utility using three case studies that illustrate the ease with which complex analyses are accomplished, and the kinds of insights derived from clustering into subgroups and from the detailed information that locates significant differences. The Ensemblator v3 enhances the structural biology toolbox by greatly expanding the kinds of problems to which this ensemble comparison strategy can be applied.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The prediction of ligand-binding residues or catalytically active residues of a protein may give important hints that can guide further genetic or biochemical studies. Existing sequence-based prediction methods mostly rank residue positions by evolutionary conservation calculated from a multiple sequence alignment of homologs. A problem hampering more wide-spread application of these methods is the low per-residue precision, which at 20{\%} sensitivity is around 35{\%} for ligand-binding residues and 20{\%} for catalytic residues. RESULTS: We combine information from the conservation at each site, its amino acid distribution, as well as its predicted secondary structure (ss) and relative solvent accessibility (rsa). First, we measure conservation by how much the amino acid distribution at each site differs from the distribution expected for the predicted ss and rsa states. Second, we include the conservation of neighboring residues in a weighted linear score by analytically optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio of the total score. Third, we use conditional probability density estimation to calculate the probability of each site to be functional given its conservation, the observed amino acid distribution, and the predicted ss and rsa states. We have constructed two large data sets, one based on the Catalytic Site Atlas and the other on PDB SITE records, to benchmark methods for predicting functional residues. The new method FRcons predicts ligand-binding and catalytic residues with higher precision than alternative methods over the entire sensitivity range, reaching 50{\%} and 40{\%} precision at 20{\%} sensitivity, respectively.

abstract = {In this work the authors show that Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) can be efficiently applied to calibrate state-of-the-art Deep Neural Networks (DNN). Our approach acts offline, i.e., it is decoupled from the training of the DNN to be calibrated. This offline approach allow us to apply our BNN calibration to any model regardless of the limitations that the model may present during training. Note that this offline setting is also appropriate in order to deal with privacy concerns of DNN training data or implementation, among others. We show that our approach clearly outperforms other simple maximum likelihood based solutions that have recently shown very good performance, as temperature scaling (Guo et al., 2017). As an example, we reduce the Expected Calibration Error (ECE{\%}) from 0.52 to 0.24 on CIFAR-10 and from 4.28 to 2.46 on CIFAR-100 on two Wide ResNet with 96.13{\%} and 80.39{\%} accuracy respectively, which are among the best results published for these tasks. Moreover, we show that our approach improves the performance of online methods directly applied to the DNN, e.g. Gaussian processes or Bayesian Convolutional Neural Networks. Finally, this decoupled approach allows us to apply any further improvement to the BNN without considering the computational restrictions imposed by the deep model. In this sense, this offline setting is a practical application where BNNs can be considered, which is one of the main criticisms to these techniques.

"Unbound" docking, which starts with the free molecules and allows for conformation changes, may be used to predict the structure of a protein-protein complex. This requires at least two steps, a rigid-body search that determines the relative position and orientation of the subunits, and a refinement step. The methods developed in the past twenty years yield native-like models in most cases, but always with many false positives that must be filtered out, and they fail when the conformation changes are large. CAPRI (Critical Assessment of PRedicted Interactions) is a community-wide experiment set up to monitor progress in the field. It offers participants the opportunity to test their methods in blind predictions that are assessed against an unpublished experimental structure. The models submitted by predictor groups are judged depending on how well they reproduce the geometry and the residue-residue contacts seen in the target structure. In nine years of CAPRI, 42 target complexes have been subjected to prediction based on the components' unbound structures. Good models have been submitted for 28 targets, and prediction has failed on 6. Both these successes and these failures have been fruitful, as they stimulated participant groups to develop new score functions to identify native-like solutions, and new algorithms that allow the molecules to be flexible during docking.},

Crystallography usually reveals more detailed information, while cryo-EM is an extremely useful technique for studying large-sized macromolecules.

The {\textless}italic{\textgreater}IPCAS{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} (Iterative Protein Crystal structure Automatic Solution) pipeline is an automatic direct-methods-aided dual-space iterative phasing and model-building procedure.

In this study, a hybrid method integrating X-ray crystallography with cryo-EM to help with structure determination is presented. With a cryo-EM map as the starting point, the workflow of the method involves three steps. (1) Cryo-EM map replacement: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}FSEARCH{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is utilized to find the correct translation and orientation of the cryo-EM map in the crystallographic unit cell and generates the initial low-resolution map. (2) Phase extension: the phases calculated from the correctly placed cryo-EM map are extended to high-resolution X-ray data by non-crystallographic symmetry averaging with {\textless}italic{\textgreater}phenix.resolve{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} . (3) Model building: {\textless}italic{\textgreater}IPCAS{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} is used to generate an initial model using the phase-extended map and perform model completion by iteration.

Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is emerging as a powerful method for studying the structure, assembly and dynamics of such macromolecules, and their interactions with substrates. With resolutions still improving, ‘single-particle' analyses are already depicting secondary structure. Moreover, cryo-EM can be combined in several ways with X-ray diffraction to enhance the resolution of cryo-EM and the applicability of crystallography.

abstract = {Docking scoring functions are notoriously weak predictors of binding affinity. They typically assign a common set of weights to the individual energy terms that contribute to the overall energy score; however, these weights should be gene family dependent. In addition, they incorrectly assume that individual interactions contribute toward the total binding affinity in an additive manner. In reality, noncovalent interactions often depend on one another in a nonlinear manner. In this paper, we show how the use of support vector machines (SVMs), trained by associating sets of individual energy terms retrieved from molecular docking with the known binding affinity of each compound from high-throughput screening experiments, can be used to improve the correlation between known binding affinities and those predicted by the docking program eHiTS. We construct two prediction models: a regression model trained using IC(50) values from BindingDB, and a classification model trained using active and decoy compounds from the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). Moreover, to address the issue of overrepresentation of negative data in high-throughput screening data sets, we have designed a multiple-planar SVM training procedure for the classification model. The increased performance that both SVMs give when compared with the original eHiTS scoring function highlights the potential for using nonlinear methods when deriving overall energy scores from their individual components. We apply the above methodology to train a new scoring function for direct inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) InhA. By combining ligand binding site comparison with the new scoring function, we propose that phosphodiesterase inhibitors can potentially be repurposed to target M.tb InhA. Our methodology may be applied to other gene families for which target structures and activity data are available, as demonstrated in the work presented here.},

abstract = {Ensembles of protein structures are increasingly used to represent the conformational variation of a protein as determined by experiment and/or by molecular simulations, as well as uncertainties that may be associated with structure determinations or predictions. Making the best use of such information requires the ability to quantitatively compare entire ensembles. For this reason, we recently introduced the Ensemblator (Clark et al., Protein Sci 2015; 24:1528), a novel approach to compare user-defined groups of models, in residue level detail. Here we describe Ensemblator v3, an open-source program that employs the same basic ensemble comparison strategy but includes major advances that make it more robust, powerful, and user-friendly. Ensemblator v3 carries out multiple sequence alignments to facilitate the generation of ensembles from non-identical input structures, automatically optimizes the key global overlay parameter, optionally performs “ensemble clustering” to classify the models into subgroups, and calculates a novel “discrimination index” that quantifies similarities and differences, at residue or atom level, between each pair of subgroups. The clustering and automatic options mean that no pre-knowledge about an ensemble is required for its analysis. After describing the novel features of Ensemblator v3, we demonstrate its utility using three case studies that illustrate the ease with which complex analyses are accomplished, and the kinds of insights derived from clustering into subgroups and from the detailed information that locates significant differences. The Ensemblator v3 enhances the structural biology toolbox by greatly expanding the kinds of problems to which this ensemble comparison strategy can be applied.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The invention of the electron microscope has greatly enhanced the view scientists have of small structural details. Since its implementation, this technology has undergone considerable evolution and the resolution that can be obtained for biological objects has been extended. In addition, the latest generation of cryo-electron microscopes equipped with direct electron detectors and software for the automated collection of images, in combination with the use of advanced image-analysis methods, has dramatically improved the performance of this technique in terms of resolution. While calculating a sub-10 {\AA} resolution structure was an accomplishment less than a decade ago, it is now common to generate structures at sub-5 {\AA} resolution and even better. It is becoming possible to relatively quickly obtain high-resolution structures of biological molecules, in particular large ones ({\textgreater}500 kDa) which, in some cases, have resisted more conventional methods such as X-ray crystallography or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Such newly resolved structures may, for the first time, shed light on the precise mechanisms that are essential for cellular physiological processes. The ability to attain atomic resolution may support the development of new drugs that target these proteins, allowing medicinal chemists to understand the intimacy of the relationship between their molecules and targets. In addition, recent developments in cryo-electron microscopy combined with image analysis can provide unique information on the conformational variability of macromolecular complexes. Conformational flexibility of macromolecular complexes can be investigated using cryo-electron microscopy and multiconformation reconstruction methods. However, the biochemical quality of the sample remains the major bottleneck to routine cryo-electron microscopy-based determination of structures at very high resolution.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

To aid in the analysis and annotation of these complexes, we have developed SSEhunter, a tool for the quantitative detection of $\alpha$ helices and $\beta$ sheets. Based on density skeletonization, local geometry calculations, and a template-based search, SSEhunter has been tested and validated on a variety of simulated and authentic subnanometer-resolution density maps. The result is a robust, user-friendly approach that allows users to quickly visualize, assess, and annotate intermediate-resolution density maps. Beyond secondary structure element identification, the skeletonization algorithm in SSEhunter provides secondary structure topology, which is potentially useful in leading to structural models of individual molecular components directly from the density. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Multiple clinical trials demonstrate the value of administering antibiotics for recurrent tonsillitis. However, there is no consensus as to the role of antibiotics in the management of adenotonsillar hypertrophy and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). It has been suggested that antibiotics may reduce adenotonsillar size, improve obstructive symptoms, and obviate the need for surgery. The goal of this pilot study was to evaluate the efficacy of a broad-spectrum antibiotic in the management of adenotonsillar hypertrophy and OSA. METHODS: Twenty-two children ages 2 through 12, with evidence of OSA, were enrolled in this double-blinded, prospective clinical trial. Children were randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups. Group I received azithromycin for a 30-day period (12 mg/kg on days 1-5; the regimen was repeated on days 11-15 and days 21-25). Group II received a placebo administered in the same regimen for a 30-day period. Overnight polysomnography was performed before and within 2 weeks after drug administration. RESULTS: Polysomnographic indices of OSA severity appear to indicate an improvement in the antibiotic as compared to the placebo group, but a comparison of mean ± standard error for each parameter failed to demonstrate statistical significance using the paired t test. Only 1 of 11 (9{\%}) children had normalization of their polysomnographic parameters. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that a course of a broad-spectrum antibiotic may be effective in temporarily improving OSA due to adenotonsillar hypertrophy, but does not appear to obviate the need for surgery. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Foundation, Inc.

abstract = {Many methods of protein structure generation such as NMR-based solution structure determination and template-based modeling do not produce a single model, but an ensemble of models consistent with the available information. Current strategies for comparing ensembles lose information because they use only a single representative structure. Here, we describe the ENSEM- BLATOR and its novel strategy to directly compare two ensembles containing the same atoms to identify significant global and local backbone differences between them on per-atom and per- residue levels, respectively. The ENSEMBLATOR has four components: eePREP (ee for ensemble- ensemble), which selects atoms common to all models; eeCORE, which identifies atoms belonging to a cutoff-distance dependent common core; eeGLOBAL, which globally superimposes all models using the defined core atoms and calculates for each atom the two intraensemble variations, the interensemble variation, and the closest approach of members of the two ensembles; and eeLOCAL, which performs a local overlay of each dipeptide and, using a novel measure of local backbone similarity, reports the same four variations as eeGLOBAL. The combination of eeGLOBAL and eeLOCAL analyses identifies the most significant differences between ensembles. We illustrate the ENSEMBLATOR's capabilities by showing how using it to analyze NMR ensembles and to compare NMR ensembles with crystal structures provides novel insights compared to published studies. One of these studies leads us to suggest that a “consistency check” of NMR-derived ensembles may be a useful analysis step for NMR-based structure determinations in general. The ENSEMBLATOR 1.0 is available as a first generation tool to carry out ensemble-ensemble comparisons.},

We first identified or created comparable databases of high-resolution crystal structures of these three protein classes. We show that the solvent-inaccessible cores of the three classes of proteins are equally densely packed. As a result, the side chains of core residues at protein-protein interfaces and in the membrane-exposed regions of transmembrane proteins can be predicted by the hard-sphere plus stereochemical constraint model with the same high prediction accuracies ({\textgreater} 90{\%}) as core residues in soluble proteins. We also find that for all three classes of proteins, as one moves away from the solvent-inaccessible core, the packing fraction decreases as the solvent accessibility increases. However, the side chain predictability remains high (80{\%} within 30 •) up to a relative solvent accessibility, rSASA 0.3, for all three protein classes. Our results show that ≈ 40{\%} of the interface regions in protein complexes are 'core', i.e. densely packed with side chain conformations that can be accurately predicted using the hard-sphere model. We propose packing fraction as a metric that can be used to distinguish real protein-protein interactions from designed, non-binding, decoys. Our results also show that cores of mem-brane proteins are the same as cores of soluble proteins. Thus, the computational methods we are developing for the analysis of the effect of hydrophobic core mutations in soluble proteins will be equally applicable to analyses of mutations in membrane proteins.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: All residues in a protein are not equally important. Some are essential for the proper structure and function of the protein, whereas others can be readily replaced. Conservation analysis is one of the most widely used methods for predicting these functionally important residues in protein sequences. RESULTS: We introduce an information-theoretic approach for estimating sequence conservation based on Jensen-Shannon divergence. We also develop a general heuristic that considers the estimated conservation of sequentially neighboring sites. In large-scale testing, we demonstrate that our combined approach outperforms previous conservation-based measures in identifying functionally important residues; in particular, it is significantly better than the commonly used Shannon entropy measure. We find that considering conservation at sequential neighbors improves the performance of all methods tested. Our analysis also reveals that many existing methods that attempt to incorporate the relationships between amino acids do not lead to better identification of functionally important sites. Finally, we find that while conservation is highly predictive in identifying catalytic sites and residues near bound ligands, it is much less effective in identifying residues in protein-protein interfaces.

abstract = {The notion of using context information for solving high-level vision and medical image segmentation problems has been increasingly realized in the field. However, how to learn an effective and efficient context model, together with an image appearance model, remains mostly unknown. The current literature using Markov Random Fields (MRFs) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) often involves specific algorithm design in which the modeling and computing stages are studied in isolation. In this paper, we propose a learning algorithm, auto-context. Given a set of training images and their corresponding label maps, we first learn a classifier on local image patches. The discriminative probability (or classification confidence) maps created by the learned classifier are then used as context information, in addition to the original image patches, to train a new classifier. The algorithm then iterates until convergence. Auto-context integrates low-level and context information by fusing a large number of low-level appearance features with context and implicit shape information. The resulting discriminative algorithm is general and easy to implement. Under nearly the same parameter settings in training, we apply the algorithm to three challenging vision applications: foreground/background segregation, human body configuration estimation, and scene region labeling. Moreover, context also plays a very important role in medical/brain images where the anatomical structures are mostly constrained to relatively fixed positions. With only some slight changes resulting from using 3D instead of 2D features, the auto-context algorithm applied to brain MRI image segmentation is shown to outperform state-of-the-art algorithms specifically designed for this domain. Furthermore, the scope of the proposed algorithm goes beyond image analysis and it has the potential to be used for a wide variety of problems for structured prediction problems.},

Although there are numerous papers on the prediction of interaction sites using information derived from structure, there are only a few case reports on the prediction of interaction residues based solely on protein sequence. Here, a sliding window approach is combined with the Random Forests method to predict protein interaction sites using (i) a combination of sequence-and structure-derived parameters and (ii) sequence information alone. For sequence-based prediction we achieved a precision of 84{\%} with a 26{\%} recall and an F-measure of 40{\%}. When combined with structural information, the prediction performance increases to a precision of 76{\%} and a recall of 38{\%} with an F-measure of 51{\%}. We also present an attempt to rationalize the sliding window size and demonstrate that a nine-residue window is the most suitable for predictor construction. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our prediction methods by modeling the Ras–Raf complex using predicted interaction sites as target binding interfaces. Our results suggest that it is possible to predict protein interaction sites with quite a high accuracy using only sequence information.},

Accordingly, an algorithm first aligns a family of sequences and a value for the extent of sequence conservation at each position is obtained. This value modifies a Gamier et al. prediction on the averaged sequence to yield the improved prediction. In addition, from the sequence conservation and the predicted secondary structure, many active site regions of enzymes can be located (26 out of 43) with limited over-prediction (8 extra).

However, no program currently exists for de novo cryoEM model building at resolutions exceeding beyond 3.5 {\AA}. Here, we present a program, EMBuilder, based on template matching, to generate cryoEM models at high resolution. The program identifies features in both secondary-structure and C$\alpha$ stages. In the secondary structure stage, helices and strands are identified with pre-computed templates, and the voxel size of the entire map is then refined to account for microscopic magnification errors. The identified secondary structures are then extended from both ends in the C$\alpha$ stage via a log-likelihood (LLK) target function, and if possible, the side chains are also assigned. This program can build models of large proteins ({\~{}}1 MDa) in a reasonable amount of time ({\~{}}1 day) and thus has the potential to greatly decrease the manual workload required for model building of high-resolution cryoEM maps.},

The devised architecture is the result of an in-depth analysis of the limitations of current networks proposed for similar applications. To overcome the computational burden of processing 3D medical scans, we have devised an efficient and effective dense training scheme which joins the processing of adjacent image patches into one pass through the network while automatically adapting to the inherent class imbalance present in the data. Further, we analyze the development of deeper, thus more discriminative 3D CNNs. In order to incorporate both local and larger contextual information, we employ a dual pathway architecture that processes the input images at multiple scales simultaneously. For post-processing of the network's soft segmentation, we use a 3D fully connected Conditional Random Field which effectively removes false positives. Our pipeline is extensively evaluated on three challenging tasks of lesion segmentation in multi-channel MRI patient data with traumatic brain injuries, brain tumours, and ischemic stroke. We improve on the state-of-the-art for all three applications, with top ranking performance on the public benchmarks BRATS 2015 and ISLES 2015. Our method is computationally efficient, which allows its adoption in a variety of research and clinical settings. The source code of our implementation is made publicly available.},

abstract = {Biological systems and processes rely on a complex network of molecular interactions. While the association of biological macromolecules is a fundamental biochemical phenomenon crucial for the understanding of complex living systems, protein-protein docking methods aim for the computational prediction of protein complexes from individual subunits. Docking algorithms generally produce large numbers of putative protein complexes with only few of these conformations resembling the native complex structure within an acceptable degree of structural similarity. A major challenge in the field of docking is to extract near-native structure(s) out of the large pool of solutions, the so called scoring or ranking problem. A series of structural, chemical, biological and physical properties are used in this work to classify docked protein-protein complexes. These properties include specialized energy functions, evolutionary relationship, class specific residue interface propensities, gap volume, buried surface area, empiric pair potentials on residue and atom level as well as measures for the tightness of fit. Efficient comprehensive scoring functions have been developed using probabilistic Support Vector Machines in combination with this array of properties on the largest currently available protein-protein docking benchmark. The established classifiers are shown to be specific for certain types of protein-protein complexes and are able to detect near-native complex conformations from large sets of decoys with high sensitivity. Using classification probabilities the ranking of near-native structures was drastically improved, leading to a significant enrichment of near-native complex conformations within the top ranks. It could be shown that the developed schemes outperform five other previously published scoring functions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the major challenges in post-genomic era is to provide functional annotations for large number of proteins arising from genome sequencing projects. The function of many proteins depends on their interaction with small molecules or ligands. ATP is one such important ligand that plays critical role as a coenzyme in the functionality of many proteins. There is a need to develop method for identifying ATP interacting residues in a ATP binding proteins (ABPs), in order to understand mechanism of protein-ligands interaction. RESULTS: We have compared the amino acid composition of ATP interacting and non-interacting regions of proteins and observed that certain residues are preferred for interaction with ATP. This study describes few models that have been developed for identifying ATP interacting residues in a protein. All these models were trained and tested on 168 non-redundant ABPs chains. First we have developed a Support Vector Machine (SVM) based model using primary sequence of proteins and obtained maximum MCC 0.33 with accuracy of 66.25{\%}. Secondly, another SVM based model was developed using position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) generated by PSI-BLAST. The performance of this model was improved significantly (MCC 0.5) from the previous one, where only the primary sequence of the proteins were used. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that it is possible to predict 'ATP interacting residues' in a protein with moderate accuracy using its sequence. The evolutionary information is important for the identification of 'ATP interacting residues', as it provides more information compared to the primary sequence. This method will be useful for researchers studying ATP-binding proteins. Based on this study, a web server has been developed for predicting 'ATP interacting residues' in a protein http://www.imtech.res.in/raghava/atpint/.},

The ability to predict the locations, directions, and extent of molecular movements can assist in fitting atomic resolution structures to low-resolution EM density maps and in predicting the complex structures of interacting molecules (docking). There are several types of molecular movements. In this work, we focus on the prediction of hinge movements. Given a single protein structure, the method automatically divides it into the rigid parts and the hinge regions connecting them. The method employs the Elastic Network Model, which is very efficient and was validated against a large data set of proteins.

abstract = {The abundant existence of proteins and regions that possess specific functions without being uniquely folded into unique 3D structures has become accepted by a significant number of protein scientists. Sequences of these intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and IDP regions (IDPRs) are characterized by a number of specific features, such as low overall hydrophobicity and high net charge which makes these proteins predictable. IDPs/IDPRs possess large hydrodynamic volumes, low contents of ordered secondary structure, and are characterized by high structural heterogeneity. They are very flexible, but some may undergo disorder to order transitions in the presence of natural ligands. The degree of these structural rearrangements varies over a very wide range. IDPs/IDPRs are tightly controlled under the normal conditions and have numerous specific functions that complement functions of ordered proteins and domains. When lacking proper control, they have multiple roles in pathogenesis of various human diseases. Gaining structural and functional information about these proteins is a challenge, since they do not typically "freeze" while their "pictures are taken." However, despite or perhaps because of the experimental challenges, these fuzzy objects with fuzzy structures and fuzzy functions are among the most interesting targets for modern protein research. This review briefly summarizes some of the recent advances in this exciting field and considers some of the basic lessons learned from the analysis of physics, chemistry, and biology of IDPs.},

To ensure chemical and structural integrity of the refined model, REFMAC5 offers several classes of restraints and choices of model parameterization. Reliable models at resolutions at least as low as 4 {\AA} can be achieved thanks to low-resolution refinement tools such as secondary-structure restraints, restraints to known homologous structures, automatic global and local NCS restraints, `jelly-body' restraints and the use of novel long-range restraints on atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. REFMAC5 additionally offers TLS parameterization and, when high-resolution data are available, fast refinement of anisotropic ADPs.

It is still challenging to detect the SSE automatically and accurately from the density maps at medium resolutions (∼5-10 {\AA}). We present a machine learning approach, SSELearner, to automatically identify helices and $\beta$-sheets by using the knowledge from existing volumetric maps in the Electron Microscopy Data Bank. We tested our approach using 10 simulated density maps. The averaged specificity and sensitivity for the helix detection are 94.9{\%} and 95.8{\%}, respectively, and those for the $\beta$-sheet detection are 86.7{\%} and 96.4{\%}, respectively. We have developed a secondary structure annotator, SSID, to predict the helices and $\beta$-strands from the backbone C$\alpha$ trace. With the help of SSID, we tested our SSELearner using 13 experimentally derived cryo-EM density maps. The machine learning approach shows the specificity and sensitivity of 91.8{\%} and 74.5{\%}, respectively, for the helix detection and 85.2{\%} and 86.5{\%} respectively for the $\beta$-sheet detection in cryoEM maps of Electron Microscopy Data Bank. The reduced detection accuracy reveals the challenges in SSE detection when the cryoEM maps are used instead of the simulated maps.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many problems in data integration in bioinformatics can be posed as one common question: Are two sets of observations generated by the same distribution? We propose a kernel-based statistical test for this problem, based on the fact that two distributions are different if and only if there exists at least one function having different expectation on the two distributions. Consequently we use the maximum discrepancy between function means as the basis of a test statistic. The Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) can take advantage of the kernel trick, which allows us to apply it not only to vectors, but strings, sequences, graphs, and other common structured data types arising in molecular biology. RESULTS: We study the practical feasibility of an MMD-based test on three central data integration tasks: Testing cross-platform comparability of microarray data, cancer diagnosis, and data-content based schema matching for two different protein function classification schemas. In all of these experiments, including high-dimensional ones, MMD is very accurate in finding samples that were generated from the same distribution, and outperforms its best competitors. Conclusions: We have defined a novel statistical test of whether two samples are from the same distribution, compatible with both multivariate and structured data, that is fast, easy to implement, and works well, as confirmed by our experiments.

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently shown outstanding image classification performance in the large-scale visual recognition challenge (ILSVRC2012). The success of CNNs is attributed to their ability to learn rich mid-level image representations as opposed to hand-designed low-level features used in other image classification methods. Learning CNNs, however, amounts to estimating millions of parameters and requires a very large number of annotated image samples. This property currently prevents application of CNNs to problems with limited training data. In this work we show how image representations learned with CNNs on large-scale annotated datasets can be efficiently transferred to other visual recognition tasks with limited amount of training data. We design a method to reuse layers trained on the ImageNet dataset to compute mid-level image representation for images in the PASCAL VOC dataset. We show that despite differences in image statistics and tasks in the two datasets, the transferred representation leads to significantly improved results for object and action classification, outperforming the current state of the art on Pascal VOC 2007 and 2012 datasets. We also show promising results for object and action localization.},

Ten newly determined structures of protein-protein complexes were used as targets for these rounds. They comprised 2 enzyme-inhibitor complexes, 2 antigen-antibody complexes, 2 complexes involved in cellular signaling, 2 homo-oligomers, and a complex between 2 components of the bacterial cellulosome. For most targets, the predictors were given the experimental structures of 1 unbound and 1 bound component, with the latter in a random orientation. For some, the structure of the free component was derived from that of a related protein, requiring the use of homology modeling. In some of the targets, significant differences in conformation were displayed between the bound and unbound components, representing a major challenge for the docking procedures. For 1 target, predictions could not go to completion. In total, 1866 predictions submitted by 30 groups were evaluated. Over one-third of these groups applied completely novel docking algorithms and scoring functions, with several of them specifically addressing the challenge of dealing with side-chain and backbone flexibility. The quality of the predicted interactions was evaluated by comparison to the experimental structures of the targets, made available for the evaluation, using the well-agreed-upon criteria used previously. Twenty-four groups, which for the first time included an automatic Web server, produced predictions ranking from acceptable to highly accurate for all targets, including those where the structures of the bound and unbound forms differed substantially. These results and a brief survey of the methods used by participants of CAPRI Rounds 3-5 suggest that genuine progress in the performance of docking methods is being achieved, with CAPRI acting as the catalyst.},

abstract = {Computed tomography (CT) is critical for various clinical applications, e.g., radiotherapy treatment planning and also PET attenuation correction. However, CT exposes radiation during acquisition, which may cause side effects to patients. Compared to CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is much safer and does not involve any radiations. Therefore, recently, researchers are greatly motivated to estimate CT image from its corresponding MR image of the same subject for the case of radiotherapy planning. In this paper, we propose a data-driven approach to address this challenging problem. Specifically, we train a fully convolutional network to generate CT given an MR image. To better model the nonlinear relationship from MRI to CT and to produce more realistic images, we propose to use the adversarial training strategy and an image gradient difference loss function. We further apply AutoContext Model to implement a context-aware generative adversarial network. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and robust for predicting CT images from MRI images, and also outperforms three state-of-the-art methods under comparison.},

abstract = {We introduce a new representation learning approach for domain adaptation, in which data at training and test time come from similar but different distributions. Our approach is directly inspired by the theory on domain adaptation suggesting that, for effective domain transfer to be achieved, predictions must be made based on features that cannot discriminate between the training (source) and test (target) domains. The approach implements this idea in the context of neural network architectures that are trained on labeled data from the source domain and unlabeled data from the target domain (no labeled target-domain data is necessary). As the training progresses, the approach promotes the emergence of features that are (i) discriminative for the main learning task on the source domain and (ii) indiscriminate with respect to the shift between the domains. We show that this adaptation behaviour can be achieved in almost any feed-forward model by augmenting it with few standard layers and a new gradient reversal layer. The resulting augmented architecture can be trained using standard backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent, and can thus be implemented with little effort using any of the deep learning packages. We demonstrate the success of our approach for two distinct classification problems (document sentiment analysis and image classification), where state-of-the-art domain adaptation performance on standard benchmarks is achieved. We also validate the approach for descriptor learning task in the context of person re-identification application.},

We introduce Selective Search which combines the strength of both an exhaustive search and seg-mentation. Like segmentation, we use the image structure to guide our sampling process. Like exhaustive search, we aim to capture all possible object locations. Instead of a single technique to gen-erate possible object locations, we diversify our search and use a variety of complementary image partitionings to deal with as many image conditions as possible. Our Selective Search results in a small set of data-driven, class-independent, high quality locations, yielding 99{\%} recall and a Mean Average Best Overlap of 0.879 at 10,097 locations. The reduced number of locations compared to an exhaustive search enables the use of stronger machine learning techniques and stronger appearance models for object recognition. In this paper we show that our selective search enables the use of the powerful Bag-of-Words model for recognition. The Selective Search software is made publicly available 1 .},

abstract = {This paper describes, and discusses Bayesian Neural Network (BNN). The paper showcases a few different applications of them for classification and regression problems. BNNs are comprised of a Probabilistic Model and a Neural Network. The intent of such a design is to combine the strengths of Neural Networks and Stochastic modeling. Neural Networks exhibit universal continuous function approximator capabilities. Statistical models (also called probabilistic models) allow direct specification of a model with known interaction between parameters to generate data. During the prediction phase, statistical models generate a complete posterior distribution and produce probabilistic guarantees on the predictions. Thus BNNs are a unique combination of neural network and stochastic models with the stochastic model forming the core of this integration. BNNs can then produce probabilistic guarantees on it's predictions and also generate the distribution of the parameters that it has learnt from the observations. That means, in the parameter space, one can deduce the nature and distribution of the neural network's learnt parameters. These two characteristics make them highly attractive to theoreticians as well as practitioners. Recently there have been a lot of activity in this area, with the advent of numerous probabilistic programming libraries such as: PyMC3, Edward, Stan etc. Further, this area is rapidly gaining ground as a standard machine learning approach for numerous problems. 1 2 there has been recent works by C. Blundell , that lead 3 into the recent relevancy of BNN.},

abstract = {The divergence accumulated during the evolution of protein families translates into their internal organization as subfamilies, and it is directly reflected in the characteristic patterns of differentially conserved residues. These specifically conserved positions in protein subfamilies are known as "specificity determining positions" (SDPs). Previous studies have limited their analysis to the study of the relationship between these positions and ligand-binding specificity, demonstrating significant yet limited predictive capacity. We have systematically extended this observation to include the role of differential protein interactions in the segregation of protein subfamilies and explored in detail the structural distribution of SDPs at protein interfaces. Our results show the extensive influence of protein interactions in the evolution of protein families and the widespread association of SDPs with protein interfaces. The combined analysis of SDPs in interfaces and ligand-binding sites provides a more complete picture of the organization of protein families, constituting the necessary framework for a large scale analysis of the evolution of protein function.},

In this context, all known methods are based on extracting uncertainty signals from a trained network optimized to solve the classification problem at hand. We demonstrate that such techniques tend to introduce biased estimates for instances whose predictions are supposed to be highly confident. We argue that this deficiency is an artifact of the dynamics of training with SGD-like optimizers, and it has some properties similar to overfitting. Based on this observation, we develop an uncertainty estimation algorithm that selectively estimates the uncertainty of highly confident points, using earlier snapshots of the trained model, before their estimates are jittered (and way before they are ready for actual classification). We present extensive experiments indicating that the proposed algorithm provides uncertainty estimates that are consistently better than all known methods.},

abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a leading technology for determining protein structures. Recent advances in this field have allowed for atomic resolution. However, predicting the backbone trace of a protein has remained a challenge on all but the most pristine density maps ({\textless} 2.5{\AA} resolution). Here we introduce a deep learning model that uses a set of cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to predict C$\alpha$ atoms along a protein's backbone structure. The cascaded-CNN (C-CNN) is a novel deep learning architecture comprised of multiple CNNs, each predicting a specific aspect of a protein's structure. This model predicts secondary structure elements (SSEs), backbone structure, and C$\alpha$ atoms, combining the results of each to produce a complete prediction map. The cascaded-CNN is a semantic segmentation image classifier and was trained using thousands of simulated density maps. This method is largely automatic and only requires a recommended threshold value for each evaluated protein. A specialized tabu-search path walking algorithm was used to produce an initial backbone trace with C$\alpha$ placements. A helix-refinement algorithm made further improvements to the $\alpha$-helix SSEs of the backbone trace. Finally, a novel quality assessment-based combinatorial algorithm was used to effectively map C$\alpha$ traces to obtain full-atom protein structures. This method was tested on 50 experimental maps between 2.6{\AA} and 4.4{\AA} resolution. It outperformed several state-of-the-art prediction methods including RosettaES, MAINMAST, and a Phenix based method by producing the most complete prediction models, as measured by percentage of found C$\alpha$ atoms. This method accurately predicted 88.5{\%} (mean) of the C$\alpha$ atoms within 3{\AA} of a protein's backbone structure surpassing the 66.8{\%} mark achieved by the leading alternate method (Phenix based fully automatic method) on the same set of density maps. The C-CNN also achieved an average RMSD of 1.23{\AA} for all 50 experimental density maps which is similar to the Phenix based fully automatic method.

We show that convolutional networks by themselves, trained end-to-end, pixels-to-pixels, exceed the state-of-the-art in semantic segmentation. Our key insight is to build "fully convolutional" networks that take input of arbitrary size and produce correspondingly-sized output with efficient inference and learning. We define and detail the space of fully convolutional networks, explain their application to spatially dense prediction tasks, and draw connections to prior models. We adapt contemporary classification networks (AlexNet, the VGG net, and GoogLeNet) into fully convolutional networks and transfer their learned representations by fine-tuning to the segmentation task. We then define a skip architecture that combines semantic information from a deep, coarse layer with appearance information from a shallow, fine layer to produce accurate and detailed segmentations. Our fully convolutional network achieves state-of-the-art segmentation of PASCAL VOC (20{\%} relative improvement to 62.2{\%} mean IU on 2012), NYUDv2, and SIFT Flow, while inference takes less than one fifth of a second for a typical image.},

Sixty-five years later, powerful new methods breathe new life into this field. The highest three-state accuracy without relying on structure templates is now at 82–84{\%}, a number unthinkable just a few years ago. These improvements came from increasingly larger databases of pro- tein sequences and structures for training, the use of template secondary structure information and more powerful deep learning techniques. As we are approaching to the theoretical limit of three-state prediction (88–90{\%}), alternative to second- ary structure prediction (prediction of backbone torsion angles and Ca-atom-based angles and torsion angles) not only has more room for further improvement but also allows direct prediction of three-dimensional fragment structures with con- stantly improved accuracy. About 20{\%} of all 40-residue fragments in a database of 1199 non-redundant proteins have {\textless}6A ˚ root-mean-squared distance from the native conformations by SPIDER2.

abstract = {The computational prediction of a protein structure from its sequence generally relies on a method to assess the quality of protein models. Most assessment methods rank candidate models using heavily engineered structural features, defined as complex functions of the atomic coordinates. However, very few methods have attempted to learn these features directly from the data. We show that deep convolutional networks can be used to predict the ranking of model structures solely on the basis of their raw three-dimensional atomic densities, without any feature tuning. We develop a deep neural network that performs on par with state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature. The network is trained on decoys from the CASP7 to CASP10 datasets and its performance is tested on the CASP11 dataset. On the CASP11 stage 2 dataset, it achieves a loss of 0.064, whereas the best performing method achieves a loss of 0.063. Additional testing on decoys from the CASP12, CAMEO, and 3DRobot datasets confirms that the network performs consistently well across a variety of protein structures. While the network learns to assess structural decoys globally and does not rely on any predefined features, it can be analyzed to show that it implicitly identifies regions that deviate from the native structure.},

Historically, its potential for application in drug discovery has been heavily limited by two issues: the minimum size of the structures it can be used to study and the resolution of the images. However, recent technological advances — including the development of direct electron detectors and more effective computational image analysis techniques — are revolutionizing the utility of cryo-EM, leading to a burst of high-resolution structures of large macromolecular assemblies. These advances have raised hopes that single-particle cryo-EM might soon become an important tool for drug discovery, particularly if they could enable structural determination for 'intractable' targets that are still not accessible to X-ray crystallographic analysis. This article describes the recent advances in the field and critically assesses their relevance for drug discovery as well as discussing at what stages of the drug discovery pipeline cryo-EM can be useful today and what to expect in the near future.},

abstract = {We study the problem of 3D object generation. We propose a novel framework, namely 3D Generative Adversarial Network (3D-GAN), which generates 3D objects from a probabilistic space by leveraging recent advances in volumetric convo-lutional networks and generative adversarial nets. The benefits of our model are threefold: first, the use of an adversarial criterion, instead of traditional heuristic criteria, enables the generator to capture object structure implicitly and to synthesize high-quality 3D objects; second, the generator establishes a mapping from a low-dimensional probabilistic space to the space of 3D objects, so that we can sample objects without a reference image or CAD models, and explore the 3D object manifold; third, the adversarial discriminator provides a powerful 3D shape descriptor which, learned without supervision, has wide applications in 3D object recognition. Experiments demonstrate that our method generates high-quality 3D objects, and our unsupervisedly learned features achieve impressive performance on 3D object recognition, comparable with those of supervised learning methods.},

abstract = {Intuitively, unfamiliarity should lead to lack of confidence. In reality, current algorithms often make highly confident yet wrong predictions when faced with unexpected test samples from an unknown distribution different from training. Unlike domain adaptation methods, we cannot gather an "unexpected dataset" prior to test, and unlike novelty detection methods, a best-effort original task prediction is still expected. We compare a number of methods from related fields such as calibration and epistemic uncertainty modeling, as well as two proposed methods that reduce overconfident errors of samples from an unknown novel distribution without drastically increasing evaluation time: (1) G-distillation, training an ensemble of classifiers and then distill into a single model using both labeled and unlabeled examples, or (2) NCR, reducing prediction confidence based on its novelty detection score. Experimentally, we investigate the overconfidence problem and evaluate our solution by creating "familiar" and "novel" test splits, where "fa-miliar" are identically distributed with training and "novel" are not. We discover that calibrating using temperature scaling on familiar data is the best single-model method for improving novel confidence, followed by our proposed methods. In addition, some methods' NLL performance are roughly equivalent to a regularly trained model with certain degree of smoothing. Calibrating can also reduce confident errors, for example, in gender recognition by 95{\%} on demographic groups different from the training data.},

abstract = {Confidence calibration -- the problem of predicting probability estimates representative of the true correctness likelihood -- is important for classification models in many applications. We discover that modern neural networks, unlike those from a decade ago, are poorly calibrated. Through extensive experiments, we observe that depth, width, weight decay, and Batch Normalization are important factors influencing calibration. We evaluate the performance of various post-processing calibration methods on state-of-the-art architectures with image and document classification datasets. Our analysis and experiments not only offer insights into neural network learning, but also provide a simple and straightforward recipe for practical settings: on most datasets, temperature scaling -- a single-parameter variant of Platt Scaling -- is surprisingly effective at calibrating predictions.},

Here we review the recent progress in cryo-EM for structural studies of dynamic biological macromolecules. Scope of review We provide an overview of the cryo-EM method and introduce contemporary studies to investigate biomolecular structure and dynamics, including examples from the recent literature. Major conclusions Cryo-EM is a powerful tool for the investigation of biological macromolecular structures including analysis of their dynamics by using advanced image-processing algorithms. The method has become even more widely applicable with present-day single particle analysis and electron tomography. General significance The cryo-EM method can be used to determine the three-dimensional structure of biomacromolecules in near native condition at close to atomic resolution, and has the potential to reveal conformations of dynamic molecular complexes.

abstract = {Remarkable progress has been made in image recognition, primarily due to the availability of large-scale annotated datasets and the revival of deep CNN. CNNs enable learning data-driven, highly representative, layered hierarchical image features from sufficient training data. However, obtaining datasets as comprehensively annotated as ImageNet in the medical imaging domain remains a challenge. There are currently three major techniques that successfully employ CNNs to medical image classification: training the CNN from scratch, using off-the-shelf pre-trained CNN features, and conducting unsupervised CNN pre-training with supervised fine-tuning. Another effective method is transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning CNN models pre-trained from natural image dataset to medical image tasks. In this paper, we exploit three important, but previously understudied factors of employing deep convolutional neural networks to computer-aided detection problems. We first explore and evaluate different CNN architectures. The studied models contain 5 thousand to 160 million parameters, and vary in numbers of layers. We then evaluate the influence of dataset scale and spatial image context on performance. Finally, we examine when and why transfer learning from pre-trained ImageNet (via fine-tuning) can be useful. We study two specific computer-aided detection (CADe) problems, namely thoraco-abdominal lymph node (LN) detection and interstitial lung disease (ILD) classification. We achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the mediastinal LN detection, with 85{\%} sensitivity at 3 false positive per patient, and report the first five-fold cross-validation classification results on predicting axial CT slices with ILD categories. Our extensive empirical evaluation, CNN model analysis and valuable insights can be extended to the design of high performance CAD systems for other medical imaging tasks.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: A popular method for classification of protein domain movements apportions them into two main types: those with a "hinge" mechanism and those with a "shear" mechanism. The intuitive assignment of domain movements to these classes has limited the number of domain movements that can be classified in this way. Furthermore, whether intended or not, the term "shear" is often interpreted to mean a relative translation of the domains.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Numbers of occurrences of four different types of residue contact changes between domains were optimally combined by logistic regression using the training set of domain movements intuitively classified as hinge and shear to produce a predictor for hinge and shear. This predictor was applied to give a tenfold increase in the number of examples over the number previously available with a high degree of precision. It is shown that overall a relative translation of domains is rare and that there is no difference between hinge and shear mechanisms in this respect. However, the shear set contains significantly more examples of domains having a relative twisting movement than the hinge set. The angle of rotation is also shown to be a good discriminator between the two mechanisms. Availability and Implementation: Results are free to browse at http://www.cmp.uea.ac.uk/dyndom/interface/.},

This work proposes a purely data driven, structure-based approach for imaging ligands as spatial fields in target protein pockets.We use an end-to-end deep learning framework trained on experimental protein-ligand complexes with the intention of mimicking a chemist's intuition at manually placing atoms when designing a new compound. We show that these models can generate spatial images of ligand chemical properties like occupancy, aromaticity and donor-acceptor matching the protein pocket. Results The predicted fields considerably overlap with those of unseen ligands bound to the target pocket. Maximization of the overlap between the predicted fields and a given ligand on the Astex diverse set recovers the original ligand crystal poses in 70 out of 85 cases within a threshold of 2 {\AA} RMSD.

The study is designed to develop a reliable prediction method using an alternative technique and to investigate the applicability of SVMs to this type of bioinformatics problem. Methods: Binary SVMs are trained to discriminate between two structural classes. The binary classifiers are combined in several ways to predict multi-class secondary structure. Results: The average three-state prediction accuracy per protein (Q3) is estimated by cross-validation to be 77.07 0.26{\%} with a segment overlap (Sov) score of 73.32 0.39{\%}. The SVM performs similarly to the 'state-of-the-art' PSIPRED prediction method on a non-homologous test set of 121 proteins despite being trained on substantially fewer examples.

Here, we formulate the statistical potentials entirely within a statistical framework, avoiding questionable statistical mechanical assumptions and approximations, including a definition of the reference state.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We derive a general Bayesian framework for inferring statistically optimized atomic potentials (SOAP) in which the reference state is replaced with data-driven 'recovery' functions. Moreover, we restrain the relative orientation between two covalent bonds instead of a simple distance between two atoms, in an effort to capture orientation-dependent interactions such as hydrogen bonds. To demonstrate this general approach, we computed statistical potentials for protein-protein docking (SOAP-PP) and loop modeling (SOAP-Loop). For docking, a near-native model is within the top 10 scoring models in 40{\%} of the PatchDock benchmark cases, compared with 23 and 27{\%} for the state-of-the-art ZDOCK and FireDock scoring functions, respectively. Similarly, for modeling 12-residue loops in the PLOP benchmark, the average main-chain root mean square deviation of the best scored conformations by SOAP-Loop is 1.5 {\AA}, close to the average root mean square deviation of the best sampled conformations (1.2 {\AA}) and significantly better than that selected by Rosetta (2.1 {\AA}), DFIRE (2.3 {\AA}), DOPE (2.5 {\AA}) and PLOP scoring functions (3.0 {\AA}). Our Bayesian framework may also result in more accurate statistical potentials for additional modeling applications, thus affording better leverage of the experimentally determined protein structures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nAVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: SOAP-PP and SOAP-Loop are available as part of MODELLER (http://salilab.org/modeller).},
