We have developed a server of the detection/prediction stage of the  AAnchor algorithm at \url{http://bioinfo3d.cs.tau.ac.il/AAnchor/}.
The server outputs the detection results in PDB format, so that they could be displayed in commonly used programs such as UCSF Chimera \cite{Pettersen2004UCSFAnalysis}.
Figure ~\ref{f:t2} illustrates the server output as shown in UCSF Chimera.
Yellow spheres, which mark the predicted locations of prolines, are superimposed with 
the reference atomic model.
