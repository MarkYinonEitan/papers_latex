\section{Summary}
As the time and cost of cryo electron microscopy experiments reduce , the ability of automatic structural analysis of experimental results becomes invaluable. 
We aim to show the potential of Deep Learning methods for analysis of cryo-EM maps.
We proposed a number of algorithms that using DL extract structural information from a cryo EM maps of high and intermediate resolution.
The proposed methods can be used for obtaining an atomic model of a molecule and for revealing its functionality.
In the final stage of our  work we will make an effort to integrate the proposed tools into an ab-initio modelling algorithm.
