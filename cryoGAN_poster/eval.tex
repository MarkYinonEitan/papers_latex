\begin{itemize}
	\item Visual inspection shows that the generated map has the features of an  experimental map.
	\item We trained an additional \textbf{ discriminator}  to distinguish between real and “fake” maps
	\item The REAL/SYM discriminator labels as real 41000 from 73000 test voxels from map

\end{itemize}
